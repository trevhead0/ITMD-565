* Very nice and easy selection.  Gives different order options with order button.
Brings to personal store to see what they like.
The actual ordering consist of multiple overarching menu items for single order vs full order.
When selecting category gives multiple menu items available for selection with pictures (i like pictures)
After selecting item, gives choice of size... ie...large or regular.
