Does have a payement system:

- payement: only after account creation
- pickup or delivery option available in top left at all times
- date= select-able at all times on top left of screen
- headcount = lets you select amount of party members.  Ask if you need more food if not enough.
- color scheme: white and green with black text and blue accent

  General catering service for many places.  Has a very simple design.
  On selection of item, gives different options for that item.
  multiple big downfalls for me: including no pictures of food, must create an account to order
  Seems a good solution for small business without websites.

# recommendation: medium.
